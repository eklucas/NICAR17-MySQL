### Data
We'll be using some Census data on Florida counties, and some campaign finance data on individual contributions from Jacksonville residents. 

All the data is in the *data* folder. 

To import the Census data through the Navicat import wizard, and to query the data, consult the tipsheet. 

To load the campaign finance data, see the `load_XXX.sql` files in the *sql* folder. 

To query the campaign finance data, see the `querying_campaign_finance.sql` file in the *sql* folder.
